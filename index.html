<h1>The Landing.</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"As the Mothership touches down, ever so gently,</em>
<em> so as to not to melt the glacier's surface,</em>
<em> I imagine the brutes of this world gaze,</em>
<em> at our splendor with awe and fright."</em></p>

<h2>The Planet of Eternal Winter</h2>
<p>I was recovering from my fatigue in my chambers when I frist sensed the excitement in the atmosphere. The Deeper Circle must have been keen on landing on this icy shard of a terra nova, gaining the support of everyone on the Mothership; or might this be something else? Everyone is excited about something around the same time, but maybe I'm over-thinking about it. I need to rest, keep monitoring my stats and get upto an optimal level, across the board.
